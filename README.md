## What's The Tea Sis?

This app is a great place to find and share your favorite Tea recipes!
Once a user signs up/logs in, the users can search by category or by recipe name.
Users can create a single recipe, adding all of the ingredients 
and directions at once or you can create a category and add multiple recipes names and discriptions, editing in the ingredients and directions later.
you are also able to comment on a recipe to share your thoughts! 

Have fun, and spill the tea!
